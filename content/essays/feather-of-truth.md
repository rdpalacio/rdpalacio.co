title: The Feather of Truth
---

In ancient Egypt, for the dead to reach eternity, they would have to pass judgment by reciting the 42 Negative Confessions ("*I have not done*"...), making sure they were no wrong doers. 

However, to keep them honest, Anubis would bring their heart to Osiris, where it was weighted in a golden balance against the feather of truth: The heart had to be even or lighter, and the measure was recorded by Thoth, Patron of the scribes.

**Three of the negative confessions got my attention:**

26. I have not shut my ears to the words of truth (e.g., climate change deniers, anti-evolutionists). 

35. I have not stopped the flow of water (e.g., "development" projects, dams, mining).

41. I have not snatched away the bread of the child (politicians who steal public funds)

If you were to pass tomorrow, will your heart be lighter than a feather?
