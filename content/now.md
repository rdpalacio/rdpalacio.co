**What I'm doing right now?**
*(updated November 9, 2020)*

I am currently in my 5th year of the phD (expected graduation Summer 2021)

I am finishing two manuscripts at the time, one is a geospatial workflow to 
produce better species ranges, the other has to do with increasing our
understanding of biodiversity patterns in the Andes.

I am also waiting for (hopefully) positive news on several grants I helped
write for Fundacion Ecotonos, we will hear about them very soon!
