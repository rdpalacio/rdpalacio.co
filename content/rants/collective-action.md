title: We need collective action
---

They tell you to buy green products and bring reusable bags.  To reduce your meat consumption or become vegan once and for all. Also don´t have children or have only one. Ride an electric car, or better no car at all. And don´t even think of getting an airplane ticket again. 

These are the kind of messages these days to "help save the environment". Yet this is not nearly enough. We are in the desperate need of collective action. It is infinitely more powerful what you and your small group of friends or neighbors can do together, that what you can do by becoming a green consumer on your own.
