***"Secundum Naturam Vivere"*** - **Live in Accordance to Nature.**

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Environment at Duke University and Science Director of [Fundacion Ecotonos](https://www.ecotonos.org), a leading NGO from Colombia focused on biodiversity conservation in the tropical Andes.

I am committed to doing science that produces workable knowledge and contributes solutions to environmental problems in the real world.

My [research]({{< ref "research.md" >}}) has been published in peer-reviewed science journals and I have appeared in different [Media]({{< ref "Media.md" >}}) outlets highlighting the impact of my scientific contributions and conservation initiatives.

*Based on my expertise, I have things to say — mostly contrarian, likely anarchical — to inform the conversation on how to deal with our current earthly affairs.*

Here I am sharing my thoughts on the environment (and society) through weekly [Rants]({{< ref "rants/_index.md" >}}) on issues that have caught my rage or love in the last few days. The opinions expressed here are my completely my own and are not of anybody else or any organization. 

I encourage you to subscribe to the [RSS Feed](http://rdpalacio.co/feed.xml) and get the content delivered to your mail. Finally, I invite you to know more [About]({{< ref "about.md" >}}) me and find out what I am up to right [Now]({{< ref "now.md" >}}).
